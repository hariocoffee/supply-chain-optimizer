# Optimization Engines - Future Scaling

This directory contains advanced optimization engines for future integration.

## Current Engines

### `ortools_optimizer_v2.py`
- **Status**: Under Development - Constraint Resolution Required
- **Issue**: INFEASIBLE status due to constraint configuration mismatch
- **Performance**: High-performance OR-Tools with advanced solver tuning
- **Use Case**: Large-scale optimization when constraint issues are resolved

## Integration Pattern

```python
# Future integration pattern
from scalability.optimization_engines import ORToolsOptimizerV2

class OptimizationEngineManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.engines = {
            'pyomo': PyomoOptimizer(),      # Production (Primary)
            'ortools_v2': ORToolsOptimizerV2(),  # Future (When ready)
        }
    
    def optimize(self, engine='pyomo', **kwargs):
        return self.engines[engine].optimize(**kwargs)
```

## Development Status

- âœ… **Pyomo Optimizer**: Production ready, stable performance
- ðŸ”„ **OR-Tools V2**: Under development, constraint issues being resolved
- ðŸ“‹ **Multi-Objective**: Planned for Phase 2
- ðŸ“‹ **Distributed**: Planned for Phase 3
